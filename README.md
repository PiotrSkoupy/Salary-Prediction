# Salary-Prediction

In this project I am focusing on my favourite sport, basketball.
I am trying to predict what salary should a player earn based on his stats.

I have used Python websraping library Beautiful Soup to get data from website www.basketball-reference.com

Later on I used R language to clean data, visualize it and find correlation between columns.
Finally I used random forests and tuned hyperparameters to predict the outcome with regression.

In the end I visualized the outcome and evalueted it with r squared.
